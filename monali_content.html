                    <p>Wildlife encompasses all organisms in natural habitats, from bacteria to mammals. Each species plays a crucial role in ecosystem balance, providing services like pollination and supporting ecotourism. <br> <br>However, human activities threaten wildlife through habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and overexploitation. Many species are endangered, underscoring the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

                    <h1 class="content-title">Endangered Species</h1>
                    <p>Endangered species are those facing a high risk of extinction in the near future. This status is typically assessed based on factors such as population size, reproductive rate, and habitat loss.<br> 
                        <br>Endangerment can be caused by various factors, including habitat destruction, poaching, pollution, climate change, and invasive species. 
                        Once a species becomes endangered, it requires concerted conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.<br><br>The plight of endangered species is a global concern, as their loss can have far-reaching ecological, economic, and cultural consequences. 
                        Efforts to conserve endangered species often involve habitat preservation, captive breeding programs, 
                        legal protection, and public awareness campaigns. Despite these efforts, many species continue to face threats, underscoring the importance of ongoing conservation initiatives.</p>

                    <h1 class="content-title">Major Threats to Wildlife and Endangered Species</h1>
                    <p>Human activities pose significant threats to wildlife and endangered species.<br><br>Habitat loss due to urbanization, agriculture, and infrastructure development leads to degradation and fragmentation. 
                        Climate change worsens these issues by disrupting ecosystems.Pollution, including air, water, and soil pollution, harms biodiversity and ecosystem health. Illegal wildlife trade drives species closer to extinction through demand for exotic pets and traditional medicines.Invasive species compete with native species and alter habitats, 
                        while overexploitation for food and medicine further threatens vulnerable species. <br><br> Mitigating these threats requires coordinated local, national, and international efforts through policies and conservation strategies.</p>
